# Using the Desktop Client 

If you're new to git and the command line generally, a good way to become more familiar with git and GitHub is to use one of their desktop clients (they have versions for both Macs and Windows).

To install the [GitHub Desktop head over to the download page](https://desktop.github.com/).

Now that you have everything installed, let's take a look at the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). 

## Clone a repository 

To clone a repository you'll first need to find something you'd like to work on. For this example, let's use the [learn-git repository](https://github.com/bulib/learn-git).

Wait, what does cloning a repository do exactly? When you make a clone of a repository you make a copy of that repository and place it in a new directory (folder) on your computer. One thing to remember about cloning a repository is that is only a copy of the repository on the day you made your clone. So if someone updates the repository, you'll have to update your clone. 

The magic button for cloning a repository on GitHub is:

Click on that icon and follow what happens in your desktop client.
