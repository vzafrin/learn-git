# Using the Desktop Client 

If you're new to Git and the command line generally, a good way to become more familiar with Git and GitHub is to use one of their desktop clients (they have versions for both Macs and Windows).

To install the [GitHub Desktop head over to the download page](https://desktop.github.com/).

Follow some of the start guide about the buttons and where things are located in the graphical user interface. 

Now that you have everything installed, let's take a look at the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). Having some understanding of the GitHub workflow will help the following steps make more sense. 

## Fork and Clone a repository 

To clone a repository you'll first need to find something you'd like to work on. For this example, let's use the [learn-git repository](https://github.com/bulib/learn-git).

Navigate to the [learn-git repository](https://github.com/bulib/learn-git) and then fork it. Not sure what forking a project is? Check out the [GitHub Guide Forking Projects](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/). Read through the guide and then fork the learn-git repository. 

Once you have your fork, clone the repository to your desktop. Wait, what does cloning a repository do exactly? When you make a clone of a repository you make a copy of that repository and place it in a new directory (folder) on your computer.  
The magic button for cloning a repository on GitHub is:

Click on that icon and you should clone the repository into your desktop client. 

## Create a branch 

Creating branches is a core concept in Git and allows us to keep one working copy - aka the master branch - and numerous branches for testing ideas, improving the project, and fixing errors. By creating a branch for a specific task or goal, you can work on that effort without effecting the master branch until it is finalized and ready to go. 

Our next task is to create a branch using the desktop client. In the desktop client use the icon on the left in the image below to create a new branch.

Branches are great but you do have to be mindful about which branch you're currently working on. In the desktop client you have a drop down that will let you know which branch you're working on. In the image above, I'm working on the using-the-desktop branch. 

Go ahead and create a new branch and move onto that branch.  

## Commit a change 

Now that you have a new branch and are on it. Pull up the using-the-desktop-tasks.md file the tasks folder gin your favorite text editor and start making some changes. 

After you have made a few edits, go ahead and make a commit. 

Do that again. And again. And one more time. 

## Submit a pull request 

Now that you have made your commits. Go ahead a submit a pull request using the desktop client.
