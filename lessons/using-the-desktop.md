# Using the Desktop Client 

If you're new to Git and the command line generally, a good way to become more familiar with Git and GitHub is to use one of their desktop clients (they have versions for both Macs and Windows).

To install the [GitHub Desktop head over to the download page](https://desktop.github.com/).

Follow some of the start guide about the buttons and where things are located in the graphical user interface. 

Now that you have everything installed, let's take a look at the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). Having some understanding of the GitHub workflow will help the following steps make more sense. 

## Clone a repository 

To clone a repository you'll first need to find something you'd like to work on. For this example, let's use the [learn-git repository](https://github.com/bulib/learn-git).

Wait, what does cloning a repository do exactly? When you make a clone of a repository you make a copy of that repository and place it in a new directory (folder) on your computer. One thing to remember about cloning a repository is that is only a copy of the repository on the day you made your clone. So if someone updates the repository, you'll have to update your clone. 

The magic button for cloning a repository on GitHub is:

Click on that icon and you should clone the repository into your desktop client. 

## Create a branch 

Creating branches is a core concept in Git and allows us to keep one working copy - aka the master branch - and numerous branches for testing ideas, improving the project, and fixing errors. By creating a branch for a specific task or goal, you can work on that effort without effecting the master branch until it is finalized and ready to go. 

Our next task is to create a branch using the desktop client. In the desktop client use the icon on the left in the image below to create a new branch.

Branches are great but you do have to be mindful about which branch you're currently working on. In the desktop client you have a drop down that will let you know which branch you're working on. In the image above, I'm working on the using-the-desktop branch.
