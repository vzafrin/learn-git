# Getting Started 

This lesson is designed to help you get started using git and GitHub. We have designed it as a mix of content and tasks to help facilitate learning. If you have any questions, issues, or suggestions, [please add an issue](https://github.com/bulib/learn-git/issues).

## Creating a GitHub Account 

Creating your GitHub account is the first set to getting started. To create an account, head over to their [Join GitHub](https://github.com/join) page and create an account. We recommend using your BU email address for contact information and creating an easy to understand username like vzafrin or tomhohenstein. 

If you have any problems, try to create an [issue]((https://github.com/bulib/learn-git/issues) and someone will help you out. 

## Navigating GitHub 

Now that you have a GitHub account, let's take a look around. In another browser window [navigate to this repository](https://github.com/bulib/learn-git). 

The first section we are going to look is, what I call, the navbar.

Don't worry if you are not familiar with the difference between code, issues, pull requests, and graphs. We'll get there one step at a time. 

### Code 

This is where your code, text files, images, or what-have-you will be found. It might be helpful to think of this as a file directory for all of the files in a repository. Just so we are all on the same page, I'm going to be discussing the area that looks like the following.

The first bit of information the code section will tell you is about the last commit. I know we are already using some git terminology, but for now think of the last commit as the last change made to the repository. The light blue section has information about who made the last commit, the message that was associated with it, the commit identifier, and when it occurred.

Below the commit information are the files and folders of the repository. You can click around the repository to view the different files. 

One great feature of GitHub that it automatically displays the readme.md file for a given folder. Knowing this allows us to communicate quickly with anyone visiting our repository (and it also makes the readme.md a great place for documentation and further information). 

### Issues 

GitHub's issue tracker is one of the best features of the service. Issues makes it easy to resolve problems with your repository, assign tasks, communicate status, and collaborate with others. There is a lot more to issues than we will cover here but using issues is critical to using GitHub. When you first land on a repositories issue page, it should look something like: 

![GitHub Issues Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bulib/learn-git/master/images/getting-started-issues-overview.png)

By default GitHub initially only shows issues that are open. If you look in the search bar next to the "labels" and "milestones" button you'll see it says "is:issue is:open." You can either remove the "is:open" from the search or click on "Closed" beneath the search bar to view closed issues.  

If you click into an example, you'll see something like below. 

![GitHub Issues Example](https://github.com/bulib/learn-git/blob/master/images/getting-started-issues-example.png)

Users can comment on issues, using Markdown, and contribute to the conversation. Admins can also apply labels, attach an issue to a milestone, and assign the issue. There's a lot to cover with issues but that should get you going and if you're feeling bold, comment on the Welcome issue. 

### Pull Requests 

To fully appreciate pull requests we have to understand the git workflow (which is a bit more than this getting started session can tackle). But for simplicity, let's say pull requests is the way for others to add their contributions to your project and when someone makes a pull request, you can find them here. Like issues, pull requests can be commented on and debated. We'll get more into pull requests later but this is place you'll look for them. 

### Wiki (may not be visiable) 

A repository's wiki is the place for the project's documentation. This is where you can find detailed information about how the code works. A great example is [Mike Bostock's D3 Wiki](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki). Perhaps as we continue working on this project we can create appropriate documentation. 

### Pulse 

The pulse tab provides a nice, quick overview of a repository's activity. You can filter by different time periods, see issues that were opened and closed, and see how many commits were made. 

### Graphs 

Similar to the pulse tab, graphs let's you see the repository's activity, however, with graphs there are a lot more options. You can look at contributors and commits as well as other visualizations like punch card and network. If you're interested in learning more about who is working on your repository. 

### Settings (may not be visible) 

If you own or have admin rights to a repository, you'll likely see the settings tab. However, if you don't you won't see it (but that's okay). The settings tab has probably exactly what you imagine it will - the settings for a repository. In this tab you can edit the repository's name, add collaborators and teams, edit branch settings, and a few other tasks. 

## Using Markdown 

Markdown is the markup language of choice for GitHub. It is a simple way to markup text to add bold, italics, headings, and other "standard" snytax features. The great news is that there a number of guides for using Markdown. A few are: 

1. [Markdown Basics](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/)
2. [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/)
3. [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
4. [Writing on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/writing-on-github/)
5. [Emoji Cheat Sheet](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/)

After reading these you'll be good to go with Markdown.
