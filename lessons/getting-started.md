# Getting Started 

This lesson is designed to help you get started using git and GitHub. We have designed it as a mix of content and tasks to help facilitate learning. If you have any questions, issues, or suggestions, [please add an issue](https://github.com/bulib/learn-git/issues).


## Creating a GitHub Account 

Creating your GitHub account is the first set to getting started. To create an account, head over to their [Join GitHub](https://github.com/join) page and create an account. We recommend using your BU email address for contact information and creating an easy to understand username like vzafrin or tomhohenstein. 

If you have any problems, try to create an [issue]((https://github.com/bulib/learn-git/issues) and someone will help you out. 

## Navigating GitHub 

Now that you have a GitHub account, let's take a look around. In another browser window open [navigate to this repository](https://github.com/bulib/learn-git). 

The first section we are going to look is, what I call, the navbar.
